1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,440
If you look at a thermal image of a city

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,030
and then compare that to a map of vegetation,

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,560
you'll find that where there's greenery,

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,863
the temperature is lower.

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,460
That's because things like

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,850
asphalt, concrete and shingled roofs

7
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,153
absorb more heat from the sun than trees.

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,440
This is the urban heat island effect,

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,960
and it accounts for the higher temperatures in cities,

10
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,290
often by several degrees

11
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,940
compared with their surroundings.

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,240
It's becoming a huge risk to human health

13
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,440
as growing urban populations exacerbate

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,453
the heating effects of climate change.

15
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,100
Heat waves kill more people

16
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,420
than any other extreme weather event,

17
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,593
more than tornadoes, hurricanes and even floods.

18
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,240
That's why urban heat island mitigation strategies

19
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,760
are being studied in Singapore

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,060
by a group of researchers.

21
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,480
The government-backed project

22
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,160
called Cooling Singapore

23
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,860
is now in the process of combining

24
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,220
everything they've learned

25
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,620
to create a digital tool

26
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,430
that can help cities all over the world,

27
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,913
starting with Singapore.

28
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,880
In Singapore, close to the equator,

29
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,770
temperatures regularly rise above

30
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:18,103
32 degrees Celsius or 90 degrees Fahrenheit.

31
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,470
And the city structures only make it worse.

32
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,610
And that is also the case for Singapore,

33
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,810
which is basically a concrete jungle,

34
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,340
more urbanized, more developed city.

35
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,820
And even in Singapore,

36
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,060
what you have is a situation whereby

37
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,320
there's a temperature difference

38
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,040
of 7 degrees Celsius

39
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,313
between the more urbanized and the more rural areas.

40
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,580
The government has taken drastic steps

41
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,023
to keep temperatures down.

42
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,560
This is Gardens by the Bay,

43
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,430
an award-winning park.

44
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,700
And inside this greenhouse

45
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,220
it's a pleasant 24 degrees.

46
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,520
That's because the dome,

47
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,450
along with two dozen nearby towers

48
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,110
full of thousands of people,

49
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,100
is chilled by what's probably the world's

50
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,603
largest underground district cooling system.

51
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,610
It uses a large central plant

52
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,740
that cools water

53
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,410
and then pipes it into banks,

54
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,720
residential towers,

55
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,130
an exhibition center,

56
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,130
shopping malls

57
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,670
and the city's iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel

58
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,023
and casino complex.

59
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:21,790
So one of the biggest perks of using this system

60
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:22,960
for the buildings is that

61
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,960
they can save 40% in terms of electricity usage

62
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,073
compared to your traditional air conditioners.

63
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,680
And with Singapore relying on natural gas

64
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,010
for most of its power,

65
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,600
this new system means emissions

66
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,310
savings equivalent to removing 10,000 cars

67
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,653
from the city's roads.

68
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,940
That has big implications for the rest of the world.

69
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,380
If things stay as they are,

70
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,368
more than a third of the world's electricity

71
00:02:49,368 --> 00:02:51,190
could end up being used to cool

72
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,423
buildings and vehicles by 2050.

73
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,550
As the world gets hotter, gets warmer,

74
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,900
there is a greater need for air conditioning

75
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,600
and as well as refrigerators, for instance.

76
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,250
And the more people are buying

77
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,640
these household appliances,

78
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,650
the more energy usage they use

79
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,070
and they release heat more,

80
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,823
and that then exacerbates climate change.

81
00:03:18,664 --> 00:03:20,410
It's a vicious circle.

82
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,350
And so since 2017,

83
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,180
researchers at Cooling Singapore

84
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,390
have been identifying design solutions

85
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,860
that reduce our need for so much

86
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,473
cool air in the first place.

87
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,880
One thing many cities have in common,

88
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,360
and that's the importance of vegetation.

89
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,877
That's a very important measure

90
00:03:37,877 --> 00:03:40,360
to mitigate the urban heat

91
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,480
because of the shading effect, of course,

92
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,010
and deep psychological effects of the vegetation.

93
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,088
And also because of the possible

94
00:03:49,088 --> 00:03:53,320
evaporative cooling effect of the vegetation.

95
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,830
Vegetation can be, of course,

96
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,220
on the ground floor

97
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,460
in form of trees and shrubs.

98
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,070
And you can walk under them.

99
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,610
This is the so-called canopy layer

100
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,330
that the vegetation forms above us.

101
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,020
But vegetation can also go up

102
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,980
the facades of buildings

103
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,130
and it can go to the roof of the buildings.

104
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,620
Luckily, Singapore has been striving

105
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,333
for the Garden City feel for quite some time.

106
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,610
It was a vision initially introduced

107
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,150
by then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in 1967

108
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,100
to make life more pleasant for people.

109
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,010
And today, Singapore is one of the world's

110
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,713
greenest cities in terms of urban vegetation.

111
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,180
Kampung Admiralty, a community center

112
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,110
that contains health facilities and social spaces,

113
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,710
now provides more green space

114
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,160
than the plot of land it was originally built on.

115
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,460
It's topped by a roofscape

116
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,010
of staggered terraces covered in local plants,

117
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,970
which functions as a community park,

118
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,520
and a village green in the center

119
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,093
that contains farm plots for residents to tend to.

120
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,900
Parkroyal on Pickering was designed

121
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,360
as a hotel in a garden

122
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,043
that doubled the green-growing potential of its site.

123
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,829
There's now 15,000 meters of sky gardens,

124
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:09,480
reflecting pools, waterfalls,

125
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,100
planter terraces and green walls.

126
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,150
And the government has big plans as well.

127
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,300
Singapore actually has a plan

128
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,950
to plant 1 million trees

129
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,220
and add more green spaces over the next 10 years.

130
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,120
It is actually a mix of one thing

131
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,658
to reduce the urban heat island effect.

132
00:05:30,658 --> 00:05:32,260
But on the other hand,

133
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,050
it's also to to get the people

134
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,993
to be more connected to nature.

135
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,390
But it's not enough.

136
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,470
The city-state has still

137
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,970
been warming twice as quickly

138
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:44,950
as the world average

139
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,070
over the past six decades.

140
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,930
That's why Cooling Singapore has developed

141
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,520
a catalog of other potential

142
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,083
heat-mitigation measures.

143
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,270
When you try to mitigate

144
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,850
the urban heat island effect

145
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,480
in a city or in any building,

146
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,960
in a village as well,

147
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,270
the first place to start

148
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,090
is by shading of the windows.

149
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,430
You have to keep areas clear

150
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,430
so that the wind can move through it.

151
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,200
Water of a certain depth

152
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,970
can act as a very good thermal buffer.

153
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,930
If you have to construct heavy buildings,

154
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,460
such as high rises,

155
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,350
at least you can make the surface,

156
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:24,070
the facade less heavy.

157
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:27,830
And you can protect it from direct sun penetration.

158
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,258
We have to make sure that no combustion engines

159
00:06:30,258 --> 00:06:32,010
will be in the city

160
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,270
in the middle,

161
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,420
in the medium- to long-term range.

162
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,040
So ideally, the electricity production

163
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,800
is outside of the city.

164
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,680
And you bring just the clean electricity

165
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,820
into the city.

166
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,130
You can at least minimize

167
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,180
the use of energy in the city.

168
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,120
And you can start to slowly convert the roofs,

169
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,030
the facades of the city,

170
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:58,090
into production areas for renewable energy.

171
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,690
In Singapore, unfortunately,

172
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,530
this is a limited option.

173
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,770
But in the long run,

174
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:07,260
it could produce up to 20%, 25% of the energy,

175
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,210
of the electricity needed in Singapore.

176
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,837
If all the roofs and the areas in the buildings,

177
00:07:12,837 --> 00:07:14,180
on the buildings,

178
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,393
on the facades would be used to do that.

179
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,920
With so many different ideas,

180
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,810
Cooling Singapore is also designing

181
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,370
a virtual model of the city to test them out.

182
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,610
It's called a Digital Urban Climate Twin, or DUCT,

183
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,400
that will calculate how each element

184
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,210
of the city's design will impact

185
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,923
the urban heat island effect.

186
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,710
That means we model not only the geometry

187
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,940
of the buildings digitally,

188
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,290
but also we model the transportation,

189
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,630
the insulation, the temperature,

190
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,120
the radiation coming from the sun,

191
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,160
the weather, the local weather,

192
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,460
the local climate,

193
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:57,127
the even very, very microclimate of the city,

194
00:07:57,127 --> 00:08:01,787
the water, the movement of people in the city.

195
00:08:01,787 --> 00:08:04,140
We can invent scenarios.

196
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,400
We can design scenarios,

197
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,420
test them before we actually build them.

198
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,360
And if they test very well

199
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,360
and we are sure that they will function,

200
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,090
then we can start to build them

201
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,663
and put them into reality.

202
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,120
Singapore will be using this new tool

203
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,110
to figure out which actions it should take next.

204
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,470
And the model can be applied to any city,

205
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,240
whether it needs to keep heat out

206
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,490
or keep heat in,

207
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,380
which will ultimately save energy,

208
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,550
slow climate change

209
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,150
and improve our quality of life.

210
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,830
So this is something that Singapore

211
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,930
will be able to export,

212
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:49,030
maybe even together with its city development systems

213
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,333
that it already has.

214
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,090
Singapore is one of

215
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,670
the very few cities in the world

216
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,590
that really combined this scientific approach

217
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:02,060
with a very well-established urban redesign

218
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,930
and urban design approach.

219
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,150
Through its agencies

220
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,350
and the combination of its agencies,

221
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,450
it has achieved a lot in the past.

222
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:14,030
If it keeps following the scientific path

223
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,950
and the combination with

224
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,960
the other knowledge in the city already,

225
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,300
we think that it will be a very comfortable

226
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,510
and very livable city in the future,

227
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,183
even more than today.
